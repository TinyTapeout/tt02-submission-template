# thunderbird tail light controller
An asic for the Ford Thunderbird. I have taken the statemachine (VHDL) from Digital Design Principles & Design, John F. Warkley
and coded before a version in my EDX course non behavioural without hazard input.
I like the idea to have a chip for the Thunderbird tail light as a replacement!

# What is Tiny Tapeout?

TinyTapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital designs manufactured on a real chip!

Go to https://tinytapeout.com for instructions!

## How to change the Wokwi project

Edit the [info.yaml](info.yaml) and change the wokwi_id to match your project.

## How to enable the GitHub actions to build the ASIC files

Please see the instructions for:

* [Enabling GitHub Actions](https://tinytapeout.com/faq/#when-i-commit-my-change-the-gds-action-isnt-running)
* [Enabling GitHub Pages](https://tinytapeout.com/faq/#my-github-action-is-failing-on-the-pages-part)

## How does it work?

When you edit the info.yaml to choose a different ID, the [GitHub Action](.github/workflows/gds.yaml) will fetch the digital netlist of your design from Wokwi.

After that, the action uses the open source ASIC tool called [OpenLane](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/openlane/) to build the files needed to fabricate an ASIC.
